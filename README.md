# MagicPass
MagicPass is a password creator which will create strong passwords and makes sure that your accounts will be safe.
This was a little fun project which I made in a day. 
Hope you guys find this useful.

This program was coded in python and it has already been compiled.

How it works?

1. All you have to do is open the dist folder and open MagicPass.exe 

2. It will then ask how long you want your password to be.

3. After it will ask you how many passwords you want to generate. 

4. You have generated the passwords and the program will auto restart.
